        <h2>Legacy of our National Hero</h2>
        <p><b>Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan,</b> often regarded as the father of Pakistan’s nuclear program, was born on April 1, 1936, in Bhopal, India, during the British Raj. His family migrated to Pakistan in 1947 after the partition of India, settling in the city of Karachi. Khan’s early education was in Pakistan, and he displayed a strong aptitude for science from a young age. He completed his schooling at a local school and later attended the University of Karachi, where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Metallurgical Engineering.

            Seeking further academic excellence, Khan moved to Europe to pursue higher studies. He enrolled at the Technical University of West Berlin, where he received his master's degree in metallurgical engineering in 1967. His thirst for knowledge continued, and he furthered his studies at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, obtaining a Doctorate in Metallurgy.</p>
